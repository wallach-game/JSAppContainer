Feature planning:
I really wish i could make and android version because cordova sucks at leats for me, but waht i can know last time i used it t was 2019 lulw. but i can be achived somewhat in same way as the desktop version, and i will be definitely better, buz im 100% sure that mobile browser would not be the same piece of shit as the Qtbrowser on desktop. definitely i want to have source code work on mobile and android at same time. iOS support is not planned now
